"""Policy-Guided Trading Agent.

A minimal agent that consumes an evidence policy and uses it to make
trading decisions in the market-path environment.

This is NOT RL training - it's a deterministic policy-guided agent that
demonstrates how experiment evidence can influence future decisions.

Purpose:
- Show how an agent consults an evidence policy for trading decisions
- Provide deterministic action selection based on policy preferences
- Demonstrate the final link in the learning loop: evidence -> decision

Example usage:
    from services.core.agent import PolicyGuidedAgent
    from services.core.policy import load_evidence_policy

    policy = load_evidence_policy("outputs/learning/evidence_policy.json")
    agent = PolicyGuidedAgent(policy)

    observation = {"symbol": "AAPL", "step": 0, "price": 150.0}
    decision = agent.decide(observation)
    explanation = agent.explain_decision(observation)

    A minimal policy-guided trading agent.

    This agent consumes an evidence policy and uses it to make deterministic
    trading decisions based on market observations.

    The agent:
    - Consults the evidence policy for symbol/step action preferences
    - Chooses actions deterministically using the policy
    - Falls back to default_action if no specific evidence exists
    - Provides explanations for each decision

    This is NOT:
    - RL training with reward optimization
    - Policy gradient learning
    - Stochastic decision making

    This IS:
    - Deterministic action selection
    - Evidence-based decision making

        2. If step_position exists in action_preferences_by_step, use that action
