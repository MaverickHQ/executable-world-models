stages:
  - id: v1
    name: Minimum Viable World Model
    description: >
      Deterministic state, transitions, and verification enabling
      safe simulation and plan evaluation without learning.
  - id: v1.1
    name: Executable World Model (AWS)
    description: >
      Cloud-deployed execution of the world model with persistence,
      artifacts, and idempotent simulation and execution.
  - id: v2
    name: Agent-Governed World Models (Planned)
    description: >
      Learned dynamics and LLM-based proposers operating inside
      verified world-model constraints.
  - id: v0.3
    name: Strategy Specs (Signals)
    description: >
      JSON strategy specifications that emit deterministic BUY/SELL/HOLD
      signals and can be exercised locally via a strategy demo.

scope:
  v1:
    - Deterministic simulation, verification, and policy enforcement.
    - Learning and agentic proposal generation are out of scope.
  v1.1:
    - Cloud execution with persistence and artifacts.
    - Learning and agents remain out of scope.
  v2:
    - Agent-governed proposals and learned dynamics.
    - VL-JEPA-style learning belongs in this stage after execution exists.
  v0.3:
    - Strategy spec JSON schema, rules, and deterministic demos.
